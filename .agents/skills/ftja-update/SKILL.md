# FTJA update

FTJA is installed by cloning its repository, so it only changes when the
user pulls. This skill does that pull safely. The user's own files
(`criteria.json`, `rubric.md`, `rubric-criteria.json`, `profile/`,
`seen.db`, digests, `.ftja-run/`) are ignored by git; an update never
touches them.

## 1. Where things stand

```
venv/bin/python -m ftja.version check --force
```

Note the installed version it prints. If it says `up to date`, tell the
user and stop.

Do not update while a run is in progress: `venv/bin/python -m ftja.lock
check .ftja.lock` — if it prints `locked`, tell the user to update after
the run finishes, and stop.

## 2. Make sure the pull can't lose anything

Run `git status --short` and `git branch --show-current`.

- **Tracked files modified** (lines starting with ` M` or `M`): the user,
  or an agent on their behalf, changed FTJA's own code or skills. Stop and
  show them the list. Offer two ways forward and let them choose: keep the
  changes aside and update (`git stash`, pull, then `git stash pop` — and
  if that conflicts, show the conflict rather than resolving it by
  guessing), or leave everything as it is. Never discard their changes.
- **Not on the default branch**: tell the user which branch they are on and
  ask before doing anything.
- Untracked files (`??`) are fine; leave them alone.

## 3. Pull

```
git pull --ff-only
```

`--ff-only` refuses rather than creating a merge when the local history
has diverged. If it refuses, report git's message and stop; do not rebase,
reset or force anything.

## 4. Dependencies and the viewer

```
venv/bin/pip install -q -r requirements.txt
```

The viewer keeps the old code in memory until it restarts. If something is
listening on port 8765 (`lsof -tiTCP:8765 -sTCP:LISTEN`), stop that process
and start it again from this folder (`venv/bin/python -m ftja.server`, in
the background), then check `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` answers.

## 5. Tell the user what changed

```
venv/bin/python -m ftja.version changes --since <the version from step 1>
```

Relay it in the user's language, leading with each version's "What changes
for you after updating" part — those are the things they will notice or
need to do. Finish with the version they are now on.
